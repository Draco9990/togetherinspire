Common questions and answers:

1. Does this mod work on gamepass?
No, gamepass version of Slay the Spire is behind the Steam version, so it is not possible to launch the game on them.

2. I'm having issues where I can't see my allies/all my rooms say waiting on data/all connecting fails.
This is usually due to an unstable internet connection, but quite often having an active VPN can also cause these issues. Please ensure that your internet is as stable as possible before playing.
